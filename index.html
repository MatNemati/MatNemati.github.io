  <h1>Matin</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I'm Matin NematI, an Electrical Engineering student.  
    You can find me on almost every platform using the handle <strong>MatNemati</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently a seventh-semester Electrical Engineering student at Isfahan University of Technology, majoring in Bioelectrics.
    My interests lie in neuroscience and systems neuroscience, and I am eager to learn and work in fields related to advanced technologies and cutting-edge science.
    I am also interested in pursuing this field in a more specialized and in-depth way.
    Solving challenges that require creativity and algorithmic thinking is something I truly enjoy.
    Physics and signal processing are also among my interests, and I am currently exploring possible connections between the brain and quantum phenomena.
